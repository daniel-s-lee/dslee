## Overview of Hacks, Study and Tangibles
Blogging on GitHub pages is a way to learn and code at the same time. 
Dates: 
8/21: I have most of the necessary tools downloaded and have been trying to edit and start on my github pages but I seem to be running into a number of problems with make and push/pull commands. I am trying to work with others in order to get them fixed and hopefully, soon it will run and I will be able to customize my pages better. 


- Plans, Lists, [Scrum Boards](https://clickup.com/blog/scrum-board/) help you to track key events, show progress and record time.  Effort is a big part of your class grade.  Show plans and time spent!
- [Hacks(Todo)](https://levelup.gitconnected.com/six-ultimate-daily-hacks-for-every-programmer-60f5f10feae) enable you to stay in focus with key requirements of the class.  Each Hack will produce Tangibles.
- Tangibles or [Tangible Artifacts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artifact_(software_development)) are things you accumulate as a learner and coder.
