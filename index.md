## Welcome to my Homepage
Hello! My name is Daniel Lee and this is my github webpage. I'm in my junior year of highschool at Del Norte. To explain some of the things on my freeform drawing, one of my favorite things to do is play and watch soccer and a lot of my time goes into soccer. I love food, some of my ffavorites is pizza, sushi, ramed, and korean BBQ. I also like to travel, on eof my favorite places to visit is Seattle. I'm a devout christian so I put the cross in my drawing. Finally, I have my family. I have three siblings: a older sister and two younger brothers.
