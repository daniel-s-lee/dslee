## Overview of Hacks, Study and Tangibles
Blogging in GitHub pages is a way to learn and code at the same time. 
Dates:
8/18: Getting used to using github and VScode was a challenge and fairly confusing but due to the help of some calssmates I was able understand how to use certain tools and almost finished downloading all of the necessary tools for the class. Still have much to work on such as my blogs and learning how to start projects that I might need to do in the future. 
8/21: I finished dowloading the tools necessary, though it was a challenge getting everything to work right away. I am also getting more and more used to using my tools and I am starting to get ready for the tool check. I added to the blog and looking for ways to add more advanced characterisitcs to my blog and projects. 
8/22: Getting more stuff done on the blog but running into problems making. Looked into the problem and will be fixing very soon. Tools are becoming more comfortable and am planning to add pictures, videos, or other interesting features to the blog to go above and beyond.

- Plans, Lists, [Scrum Boards](https://clickup.com/blog/scrum-board/) help you to track key events, show progress and record time.  Effort is a big part of your class grade.  Show plans and time spent!
- [Hacks(Todo)](https://levelup.gitconnected.com/six-ultimate-daily-hacks-for-every-programmer-60f5f10feae) enable you to stay in focus with key requirements of the class.  Each Hack will produce Tangibles.
- Tangibles or [Tangible Artifacts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artifact_(software_development)) are things you accumulate as a learner and coder.
