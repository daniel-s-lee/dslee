    "## Problems, Solutions, and Improvements\n",
    "During the first week of this class, I faced a variety of challenges due to my unfamiliarity with certain tools. For example, at first I didn't know how to set up github pages or how to push, pull, and commit on github and VScode. I also didn't have much experince using Power Shell on my computer or dowloading so many different tools. However, with the help of my classmates and partners, I was able to figure out how to work these things and got more comfortable in these areas. I have improved in my familiarity with VScode, github pages, wiritng blogs, and overall have a better idea on how I set up a good environment for the class. "
