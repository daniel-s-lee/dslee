    "- Question 23 - True Statement About the Internet\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer B is correct . I think I got this wrong because in the answer I chose, it said that the Internet uses propietary protocalls but I didn't know that propietary was referring to ownership. The Internet was designed to be scalable, using open protocols to easily connect additional computing devices to the network.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Question 25 - Result of Iteration Statements\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer D is correct because the procedure initially sets result to 1 and j to 2. In the REPEAT UNTIL loop, result is first assigned the sum of result and j, or 1 + 2. The value of j is then increased to 3. In each subsequent iteration of the loop, result is increased by each successive value of j (3, 4, 5, etc.) until j exceeds n. Therefore, the procedure returns the sum of the integers from 1 to n. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Question 26 - Algorithm not suited for parallel computing\n",
    "\n",
    "I got this one wrong because I forgot what parallel computing was. After searching it up, I know that answer A is correct because the efficiency of a parallel computing solution is limited by the sequential portion of the solution. Therefore, the solution is completely sequential and does not benefit from parallel computing.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Question 37 - Which is not a possible value displayed\n",
    "\n",
    "I got this one wrong because I looked over the IF ELSE statement. Answer C is correct. Carrot can only be displayed when the expression (n > 10) is false and the expression (n > 100) is true. If n is not greater than 10, it cannot be greater than 100, and so \"carrot\" can never be displayed.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Question 38 - Situation where simulation is unsuitable\n",
    "\n",
    "I got this one wrong because I wasn't aware of when a simulation is most beneficial. Answer D is correct because simulations are most useful when real-world events are impractical. A simulation is unlikely to be appropriate if continuous real-world data is needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Question 42 - Iterate over integerList\n",
    "\n",
    "I got this one wrong because I didn't know what the expression (item MOD 2) really did. Answer A is correct because the expression (item MOD 2) evaluates to 1 for odd values and evaluates to 0 for even values. As a result, the code segment adds 1 to result for each odd value in integerList. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Question 52 - Binary Search on a list of 128 items\n",
    "\n",
    "I got this one wrong because I forgot how a binary search element worked. Answer B is correct. The binary search algorithm starts at the middle of the list and repeatedly eliminates half the elements until the desired value is found or all elements have been eliminated. For a list with 128 elements, the list will be cut in half a maximum of 7 times. 128,64,32,16,8,4,2,\n",
    "\n",
    "- Question 55 - Move element from end of list to beginning\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer C is correct. This code segment assigns the value of the last element of the list to the variable temp, then removes the last element of the list, then inserts temp as the first element of the list.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Question 67 - Behavior of blue orange purple spinner\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer A was correct but answer C was not. The Correct answer was A and D. I didn't include the fact that if the first spin isn't 1, then it needs to spin again to a value in between 1 and 2 inclusive. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Question 68 - Error in remove duplicates code segment \n",
    "\n",
    "I think I just read over the NOT part of the question and got both of them wrong. Answers A and C are correct. Answer A is correct because as it iterates over from right to left, it removes the sixth, forth, and second element resulting in [10,20,10] which still contains duplicates. Answer D is correct because as it itereates it won't remove any adjacent elements even though 40 appears twice.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Question 70 - Remove nth character from oldStr\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer C was correct but Answer A was also correct, not B. Answer A was correct because the code segment assigns the characters to the left of position n to the variable left and the characters to the right of position n to the variable right. It then concatenates left and right and assigns the result to newStr.\n",
