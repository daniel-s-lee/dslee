    "## Quiz Corrections\n",
    "- Question 23 - True Statement About the Internet\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer B is correct because the Internet was designed to be scalable, using open protocols to easily connect additional computing devices to the network.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Question 25 - Result of Iteration Statements\n",
    "\n",
    "Option B is incorrect because the procedure does not return the value of 2 * n. For a procedure to return 2 * n, it could initialize result to 0 and then repeatedly add 2 to result a total of n times.\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer D because the procedure initially sets result to 1 and j to 2. In the REPEAT UNTIL loop, result is first assigned the sum of result and j, or 1 + 2. The value of j is then increased to 3. In each subsequent iteration of the loop, result is increased by each successive value of j (3, 4, 5, etc.) until j exceeds n. Therefore, the procedure returns the sum of the integers from 1 to n.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Question 26 - Algorithm not suited for parallel computing\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer A is correct because the efficiency of a parallel computing solution is limited by the sequential portion of the solution. If each step is dependent on the preceding step, then each step must wait for the previous step to complete before executing. Therefore, the solution is completely sequential and does not benefit from parallel computing.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Question 37 - Which is not a possible value displayed\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer C is correct. The string \"carrot\" can be displayed only when the expression (n > 10) is false and the expression (n > 100) is true. If n is not greater than 10, it cannot be greater than 100, and so \"carrot\" can never be displayed.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Question 38 - Situation where simulation is unsuitable\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer D is correct because simulations are most useful when real-world events are impractical. A simulation is unlikely to be appropriate if continuous real-world data is needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Question 42 - Iterate over integerList\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer A is correct because the expression (item MOD 2) evaluates to 1 for odd values and evaluates to 0 for even values. As a result, the code segment adds 1 to result for each odd value in integerList. There are three odd values in the list, so 3 is displayed.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Question 52 - Binary Search on a list of 128 items\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer B is correct. The binary search algorithm starts at the middle of the list and repeatedly eliminates half the elements until the desired value is found or all elements have been eliminated. For a list with 128 elements, the list will be cut in half a maximum of 7 times (causing 8 elements to be examined). The list will start with 128 elements, then 64 elements, then 32 elements, then 16 elements, then 8 elements, then 4 elements, then 2 elements, then 1 element.\n",
