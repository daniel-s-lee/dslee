    "### Plans\n",
    "I made plans for each week of CSP so that it's easier for me to stay on task, know what I'm supposed to be doing throughout the week, and make it easier to catch up to any work I might have fell behind on. It also allows me to make sure I have everything that's supposed to completed on time. Each of the plans can be found in my Time Box and all of them are filled with my specific plans for that week. \n",

This blog will help me in the future so I can look back and assure that I am using the commands accurately. This blog will also serve as a log that I can look back on next trimester. This blog also answers whether there are commands we use to verify tools we install, review versions, how to update a repository, and if we use the git command line. \n",

    "#### Python Snake Game\n",
    "In my Time Box I have a link to the classic snake game, coded entirely with Python. At first the code made it so that the snake and the food the snake eats is the same color, white, but I changed the code so that only the red would turn red. Making it much easier to differentiate the snake's body to the food. At first there was problem with both the snake and food turning red but that was because the food and the snake weren't seperate in the code; after making them seperate it fixed the problem. "

The original code for the quiz was very long and repetitive at times so what I did was make the original code more concise by adding lists, redefining variables, and I added a percentage calculator as well. The quiz worked very well and the only reason why my teamates' quizzes are different is because they decided to make a new type of quiz through replit. They made the quiz as a multiple choice test instead. "

    "### Chat GPT Review\n",
    "Below are some of the feedback I got for my code after asking ChatGPT to review it for me. It helped me perfect my code and make sure that I add certain features that would enhance the functionality of my code.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is what it gave me after I asked it to review the code for my calculator: \n",
    "\n",
    "HTML:\n",
    "Structure: The HTML structure for the calculator and animation containers seems well-organized.\n",
    "\n",
    "CSS: The CSS code for styling the calculator looks good. It uses CSS Grid for layout, and the styling is consistent. The comments within the CSS code are helpful for understanding the styling choices.\n",
    "\n",
    "JavaScript:\n",
    "Variable Declarations: Variable declarations are clear and well-commented. However, consider using let or const instead of var for variable declarations to follow modern JavaScript practices. var has functional scope, which can lead to unexpected issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "Event Listeners: The event listeners for number buttons, operation buttons, clear button, and equals button are well-structured and functional.\n",
    "\n",
    "Functions: The functions are named descriptively and follow a clear naming convention. This enhances code readability. However, consider adding comments before or after each function to describe what it does.\n",
    "\n",
    "Error Handling: The code assumes that the user will input valid calculations and does not handle potential errors (e.g., division by zero). Adding error handling would make the calculator more robust.\n",
    "\n",
    "Type Conversion: When getting input from the user (e.g., parseInt(output.innerHTML) and parseFloat(output.innerHTML)), it's a good practice to validate that the conversion was successful or provide default values if the conversion fails to avoid unexpected behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "Operator Precedence: The calculator doesn't handle operator precedence (e.g., the order of operations), so calculations are performed in a left-to-right manner. You might want to consider adding support for operator precedence if needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Animation: The code for adding Vanta.js animations is correctly placed and seems to work well. However, make sure to include the correct paths to the Vanta.js scripts.\n",
    "\n",
    "Comments: The code has some comments, but adding more comments, especially within complex functions like calculate, would make it even more understandable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Clear Function: The \"A/C\" button clears the calculator, which is good, but you might want to consider adding a confirmation dialog or confirmation logic to prevent accidental data loss.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, your code seems functional and well-structured. To improve it further, consider incorporating some of the suggestions mentioned above and ensure that the paths to external scripts are correct for the animation to work as intended.\n",
    "\n",
    "After hearing this feedback from ChatGPT, I made the necessary changes and now my calculator has more features than before such as the suggested error handling and adding more comments. It aslo fixed a problem where my calculator wouldn't show up right and the animation wouldn't appear. \n",
