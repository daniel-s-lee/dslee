    "# Key Involvements in Group Project\n",
    "As our final project, me and my team decided to create a geoguesser inspired game of Del Norte. Once you get to the website, you would have to press the start button in order to get to the game where you would be shown an image of a classroom or other part of our school and you would have to click on the Del Norte map where you think the location is. If you get it right you get one point, if wrong you get zero points. In this project I had many key involvements.\n",

    "## Frontend\n",
    "Engaging in frontend development and collaborating closely with my teammates has been a profoundly enriching experience that has allowed me to witness the power of effective teamwork. As a member of the frontend development team, my primary focus was on crafting user interfaces that seamlessly combined functionality and aesthetics. I actively participated in design discussions, providing valuable insights and ideas to enhance the user experience. My contributions extended beyond individual coding tasks; I embraced collaboration by engaging in regular code reviews, offering constructive feedback, and incorporating suggestions from my peers. This collaborative atmosphere not only accelerated the development process but also cultivated a sense of shared ownership and pride in our work. We navigated through challenges together, brainstorming innovative solutions and learning from one another in the process. Through this journey, I came to appreciate the strength that diversity of thought brings to a team, as each teammate brought their unique skills and perspectives to the table. Our collective efforts resulted in the successful delivery of a frontend that not only met but exceeded expectations, highlighting the significance of teamwork in achieving outstanding outcomes in the realm of frontend development.\n",

    "## Backend\n",
    "In collaborating with backend developers to test an API, I found the experience both rewarding and enlightening. Working closely with the development team, I played a pivotal role in ensuring the reliability and functionality of the API. Our collaboration involved creating and executing comprehensive test cases, scrutinizing various endpoints, and validating data integrity. Through this process, I gained a deeper understanding of the intricacies of the API and its interactions with different components. The close communication with backend developers allowed for a seamless exchange of insights and prompt issue resolution. This hands-on involvement not only sharpened my testing skills but also fostered a sense of teamwork and shared responsibility. As we collectively navigated through potential challenges, I realized the significance of a collaborative approach in delivering a robust and efficient API. This experience underscored the importance of effective communication and mutual understanding between testing and development teams, ultimately contributing to the overall success of the project.\n",

    "The first ever draft of what our game would look like and would eventually be the design we go with for our final project. \n",

    "[First Coordinate Implementation](https://github.com/rliao569/Frontend-CSP/commit/4be22efe239dd65f6bba2025e964b9cee5ed64a5)\n",
    "This would be the first coordinate system made of javascript so that we can scale the image properly and be able to but the buttons in more precise locations\n",

    "I added a change to our code that would store where the button last appeared and made sure that the user would not get the same location twice in a row\n",

    "At first our frontend was only running code on external websites and code testers and this was the first time me and my teammates implemented it so that it would actually work on a local host and on our server. \n",
    "### Issue\n",
    "[Double Message Pop-Up](https://github.com/rliao569/Frontend-CSP/issues/5)\n",
    "Very inconvenient porblem in our game that lowered user experience, however the fix was very simple and eneded up being an important part of improving quality of our game\n",

    "## Improvements that could be made\n",
    "Although our prject turned out well, there were still improvements that we as a team could have done: \n",
    "One was collaboration during presentations. When we presentented our project and other assignments lots of times one person would be the main speaker and presenter when we should have got everyone to speak and contribute to the presentation. This is something that all of us should remember and carry on into the next rimester to ensure success and better learning. \n",
    "Another aspect of our project specifically that we should have done is to add more features that would make our game more aimed towrds a general audience instead of a specific group of people. Having a lerger target audience allows us to make code that is relevant and beneficial to everyone and allows us to make better code. \n"

    "### Questions I Got Wrong\n",
    "Question 8: Metadata About Photos\n",
    "I got thiquestion wrong because I misunderstood the data provided. I thought that the data would be able to provide the anme of the person that took the most recent photo however, it the data provided would not be able to. So the correct answer was the the data could only provide the particular geographic location and and the number of photos that were taken in the last year. \n",

    "Question 24: Compression by replacing TH and IS with Characters\n",
    "I got this question wrong because I didn't understand why Byte pair encoding is an example of lossless transformation. Specifically what lossless transformation is. Orginally, I my answer said that byte pair encoding is a lossless transformation because it could be used to transmit imformation securely but now I understand that it's because the encoded string could be reverted back to the original form by replacing the symbols with TH or IS. \n",
    "\n",
    "Question 25: Shortening string by replacing TH and IS\n",
    "I got this question wrong because I still didn't understand that byte pair encoding is. Byte pair encoding is only possible when a pair of characters show up more than once. So the answer I chose (BANANA) was wrong because the character pair AN could be replaced with a symbol like \"*\" to shorten it. So my answer was wrong and the correct answer was LEVEL_UP because this word is not able to be shortened because a pair of character don't repeat more than once. \n",
    "\n",
    "Question 29: Diagram with Three Logic Gates\n",
    "I got this question wrong because I didn't have a full understanding of how logic gates worked. I didn't understand what type of output the AND and OR gates would produce. After some research on how Logic gates worked, I learned that the the correct answer is correct because the AND gate would produce false, and the first OR gate would also produce false. Because both the outputs in the second OR gate would be false, the circuit will have an output of false. \n",
    "\n",
    "Question 64: Cloud Computing and the Internet\n",
    "I got one out of two of the correct answers for this question. The one I got wrong is wrong because cloud computing did not affect internet communication by eliminating the need to provide redundancy in Internet routing. Redundant routing provides false tolerance, which enables a cloud storage site to continue to operateif some part of the network fails. So this answer is wrong. The correct answer is correct because cloud computing sites must consider security concerns in order to protect their users' private data. So cloud computing has affected Internet communication because cloud computing has introduced new data security concerns. "
